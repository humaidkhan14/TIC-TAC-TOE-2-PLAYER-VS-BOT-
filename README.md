# TIC-TAC-TOE-2-PLAYER-VS-BOT-
Developed a Tic Tac Toe game using C++ and Qt Framework with an interactive GUI. The game supports Two-Player mode (Player vs Player) as well as Player vs Bot (AI) mode. Implemented logic for win/draw detection, turn management, and real-time result display. Included a restart/reset feature for smooth gameplay and multiple match sessions.
